# Ice-scrum-Team-Project
Welcome to the ice-scrum creator space! We hope you're ready for an exciting coding adventure. Let's dive in and have a blast creating awesome projects together!

We are currently in the process of building our website using WordPress.org. We may consider adopting Spring Boot for backend development, along with Spring Data JPA to handle the database, if WordPress.org does not meet our needs.


Initialization stage:
I will 
1. create an aws sever free tier to request a server, since it is required to install wordpress.org.
2. then install wordpress.org accordingly (https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/before-install/howto-install/)
3. install wordpress to aws EC2 instance (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/tutorials-wordpress.html)
4. write a simple guide(as I am also a beginner) of using JPA and configurating an environment for spring boot with intellij IDEA IDE.
5. Set up pom.xml for project build dependencies through Maven.
6. 


Implementation stage:
1. Start with UML design.
2. Create unit tests for the classes in the UML:
   - Set up JUnit 5 testing framework for Spring Boot.
   - Add JUnit dependency to pom.xml.
   - Create unit tests for each class's constructors and methods including any getters/setters using the [Red-Green-Refactor approach](https://www.codecademy.com/article/tdd-red-green-refactor).
3.
